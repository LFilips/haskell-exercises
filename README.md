# Haskell exercise

Repository with exercise that I've done in haskell to improve my understanding of functional programming

## Command
To compile a hs need to use the ghc simply issuing the command:

`ghc filename`

Otherwise the interactive compiler can be used with:

`ghci filename`

This will run an interactive ghci session loading the module in memory. To exit from the ghci use :q
